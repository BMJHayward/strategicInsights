The difference is significant. Obviously, the other card was not cut out for it, but this one blows me away! Things that took 30 minutes to render now take 10! The first one I had was faulty with an unusually loud fan, but Newegg made the exchange very easy. I recommend this card, the price is very fair. The sad part is the 1050 almost cost me as much as this thanks to crytocurrency craze at the time!    2 out of 2 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Ownership: 1 day to 1 week  Verified Owner         4 / 5   Great Card, But Poor Stock Fan Settings  12/5/2019 8:02:32 AM       Pros: -Best sub-$300 card you can get! -Runs everything 1080p maxed!   Cons: -Poor stock fan curves, runs hot without adjustment...   Overall Review: This is a great card for 1080p gaming, the best you can get in the RX series if you don't already own a previous RX card. But if you already own an RX 580 or even an RX 480 you can overclock it enough to get the same results as this card. It's still a great card out of the box and well worth the price if you don't already own an RX card, it runs pretty much any game on 1080p max except for a few early access titles like Star Citizen. The only bad thing about this card is the stock fan settings, for some reason it likes to stay at 20% speed and it goes up to 85c under full load which is technically ok but could shorten the lifespan of the card, I made my own custom fan curves in the control panel and got that down to 70c under full load with 40% fan speed at that level. I highly recommend anyone buying this card to set your own fan curves to ensure longevity of the product.    Did you find this review helpful?

My son bought one at the same time and both cards have been flawless.  Very happy.    Did you find this review helpful?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!

Cons: Still have to dial settings back a bit at 4k in most games less than four years old.   Overall Review: A much bigger improvement coming from a vanilla 2070 than I expected. I was expecting something more like a 15, maybe 20% increase in performance, but I've seen as much as an increase from 40 fps to 75 at the same settings as the 2070.

Cons: You would think after spend all this money that the manufacturer would at least light up the card name with white. I EXPECTED this and should have EXPECTED this. I'm not asking for RGB. I knew that already. Even my OLD card had the name lit up-EVGA GTX980. Even my REALLY OLD sound Card-Soundblaster XFi has the name lit up.   Overall Review: I give this a 9. If the name on the card was lit up it would been ten.    1 out of 5 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!

This card however routinely creeps into the mid 80's when gaming, even with the fans cranked to near max.

No illumination like previous GPUs from EVGA Awaiting response from EVGA Support Ticket Apparently, reading the RMA process, it will COST ME in some form to have a replacement shipped to me, or the dud shipped back to EVGA … this is ON TOP of a $700 price tag!! OUCH!! NOT NICE!!   Overall Review: BUYER BEWARE I am finding noticeable graphical artifacts while gaming, routine crash to desktop, and constant rainbow/shimmer on all white text when using the dark theme in windows 10. Note, I do not have this issue using a different GPU on my current monitor, and in both cases using the same driver from NVIDIA (436.30)    2 out of 8 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

I have the Ghost S1 case and the top lid wouldn't close because it gets stuck at the cable even when forcing the wires to be as flat as possible.   Overall Review: I don't understand the point in making a small card for small form-factor PCs and messing up the height.    0 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Good Bang for Buck  10/1/2019 11:08:55 AM       Pros: Reasonably priced Color neutral design Has a backplate Relatively quiet Reasonable temperatures Incredibly efficient   Cons: Fans cannot run lower than 1400 RPM (no zero rpm mode) Wish it had 8 GB of VRAM instead of 6   Overall Review: When I was building my second rig, this was the toughest decision to make. I was going to get an RX 5700, but I later decided it was really overkill for 1080p. Wasn't really feeling the RTX 2060 and the RX 590 is too far of a step down, and I couldn't find any new Vega 56s that I was interested in (i'm a little scared of used hardware if you can't tell). Eventually I decided to grab this. It was small, so it was perfect for my build. It is also crazy efficient compared the RX 590. I normally don't care about that sort of thing but it is a nice bonus. As for the performance, it absolutely knocks 1080p out of the park. I can max out Forza Horizon 4, Forza Motorsport 7, DIRT 4, and Skyrim with ease, barring any crazy AA settings on DIRT 4. If you dial back some settings you could get very close to or hit the 144 FPS mark, which is something else, let me tell ya! Now for some of the negatives, although neither of them are truly even a big deal. Unlike my much cheaper RX 570, there is no zero RPM mode, at least based on what I've seen so far. I didn't see a way to configure this in the NVIDIA control panel, and MSI Afterburner won't let me put the fans below 41%. That being said, the fans are quiet anyway so it hardly matters. Thanks to this it idles in the 30s as opposed to my RX 570 which was in the 50s. The VRAM also raises a concern for me. While 6 GB is perfectly adequate now for 1080p, I worry about it in a few years time. For me, games typically use around 4 GB. It SHOULD be fine but I worry that I'll start hitting the VRAM capacity and running into performance issues in the near-ish future. Few other things to note, if you have a Freesync display, see if you can enable G-Sync. I managed to get it working on my Freesync display as I had an AMD card before this, and it works very well barring a few errors. Really helps performance in a lot of games which were previously very choppy, particularly FM7 which suffered a host of performance issues. So basically, you should buy this card. Although with rumors of the RX 5600 around the corner, and supposedly the 1660 Super, I'd highly recommend holding out until then. As of me writing this though, this is possibly the best 1080p card, 2nd to the RTX 2060 or Vega 56.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

The new current tech drives down the price of the still capable older tech - creating bargains.  This is an oddball video card where nVidia actually followed that strategy because not many RTX games were being released. The newer nVidia tech is RTX (ray tracing) so for this card, they took the hardware for the RTX - more transistors, more pipelines, more bandwidth and ripped out the RTX and put GTX in on top of the better hardware. That is why this is a sweet spot mid-range card with the newer hardware developed for RTX running the older GTX package.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Cons: Opened the box and no install cd per manual instructions and no 8 pin power connector. Install cd maybe no problem getting installed but assumed there would be a power connector! My Corsair tx650 had a 6 pin but not 8 pin. Looking to buy one locally now.   Overall Review: Looks great but that's all I can say for now.    0 out of 21 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Ownership: 1 month to 1 year  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Excellent card  8/14/2019 12:11:21 AM       Pros: Great card, fast on a 75Hz 2560 monitor, absolutely outstanding for the price range. Bought two of these for myself and a friend, we have no complaints whatsoever, they run any games we've tried just fine. Nvidia's Turing architecture is just awesome.   Cons: None   Overall Review: Some people complained about this card running hot when it's at 70. That's NOT really that hot for a decent card performing well. Not sure what people expect, if you have liquid cooling it would go down some. But this is literally the best bang for the buck, I did extensive research and comparison before buying. We had RX 580 8 GB cards for a very short time but they were awful, kept blinking black every few minutes and running REALLY hot all the time, we dumped them and got this card and haven't looked back. If you're looking at NOT spending a small fortune for a really high performance card, just buy this and you will not be disappointed. It is the very best for under 300 that you can get.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!

The Armour performs slightly better but at a higher price.  With the proper OC/tweaking, this is a decent choice.   Cons: I am using three different 1660 Ti GPUs.  They're a great value.  This once comes in second place after the MSI 1660 Ti Armour.   Overall Review: A good combination of price and performance.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Take control with Radeon RX 5700 XT and experience powerful accelerated gaming customized for you.           SAPPHIRE COOLTECH  Our superior cooling technology to keep your temperatures low at a high framerate  Intelligent Fan Control  Fan speed is intelligently controlled to keep the GPU, memory, PWM IC and other components as low as possible in temperature to balance performance, and fan noise.  Precision Fan Control  Standard industry fans may have up to 10% difference between fan rotation cycles (RPM). The Fan IC Control on SAPPHIRE graphics cards reduce differential at approximately 3%. This up to 70% improvement on accuracy ensures that cooling and noise performance of every graphics card is up to scratch.  Robust VRM Cooling  The SAPPHIRE graphics cards are designed with robust VRM cooling and have a high thermal conductivity pad on the back-plate to take away the heat efficiently and effectively.  Robust Memory Cooling  One of the hottest parts on a next-gen graphics card is generated from memory. A robust memory cooling solution has been integrated into each SAPPHIRE graphics card to cool down memory with a specially designed independent cooling module.  Dual-X Cooling Technology  SAPPHIRE's acclaimed Dual-X Cooling is powered by two massive yet silent fans and state-of-the-art radiator design. The streamlined form of our 95mm blades mean greater airflow and superior heatsink coverage at lower noise compared to standard cooling designs.       SAPPHIRE DNA  Our core parts that elevate the life of our products through quality, robustness & reliability  Backplate (Tough Metal Backplate)  The all-aluminum backplate provides additional rigidity that guarantees nothing bends and dust stays out. It also helps cool your card by increasing heat dissipation.  Two-Ball Bearing  These feature Dual Ball bearing fans, which have an approximately 85% longer lifespan than sleeve bearings in our tests. The improvements to the fan blades means the solution is up to 10% quieter than the previous generation.  Fan Quick Connect  If there's a fan problem, you don't have to return the entire card. SAPPHIRE or our channel partners will send out a replacement fan directly to you! That means they're easy to remove, clean and replace, with just one screw holding them securely in place.  Fuse Protection  In order to protect your card, the SAPPHIRE cards have fuse protection built into the circuit of the external PCI-E power connector to keep the components safe.  Dual BIOS  Choose between performance mode or silent mode to enhance your gaming experience.       SAPPHIRE PLUS  All of the extra features that make our SAPPHIRE Boards so special and unique  TriXX Supported  Customize your individual style with TriXX Software and heighten your gaming experience!  TriXX Boost  Take gaming to the next level by adjusting your resolution options. Gain FPS by slightly decreasing resolution that is then adjusted through image sharpening for a more immersive gaming experience with much more fine-grained control over the quality vs. performance tradeoff.  Power Design  SAPPHIRE PULSE cards are designed with 7+1+2 Phase Digital Power specifically for GPU and memory to aid in overclocking, balancing current distribution and averaging thermal dissipation for each power phase.  Fan Check  At times fans need service but it can be frustrating to return the entire card and wait for a replacement to be authorized. Fan Check feature allows users to check the cooler's status and immediately contact customer support through Fan Service in case of problems.  Free Flow  The traditional axial fan design system circulates hot air to the fan inlet resulting in higher temperature. We redesigned the airflow so that the hot air is expelled through the system fan instead, rapidly dissipating heat and includes a tunnelled fin with tiny holes which increases the convection airflow.

Ownership: 1 month to 1 year  Verified Owner         2 / 5   Sapphire 5700 XT is garbage  12/1/2019 2:14:50 PM       Pros: The few times it works, it's good   Cons: I have NEVER had as many crashes, bugs and issues with a GPU before. Every game I play it either crashes into a full system reboot or freezes in-game  and then boots me back to desktop. I have had to uninstall then reinstall the drivers about 100times now. This GPU is straight GARBAGE!!!   Overall Review: I would never recommend this to someone else    0 out of 2 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!     Manufacturer Response:  Sorry to hear about the issues you have had. The 5700 series did have some early driver issues but the last few drivers have cleaned things up nicely. Do a full DDU and then install the newest drivers.           Curt S.  Ownership: 1 month to 1 year  Verified Owner         1 / 5   Stay Away! Unless you like BSOD, hangs, restarts, missing devices  11/30/2019 12:44:55 PM       Pros: Zero Pros. Wait, it fits in a mATX case. There's one.   Cons: The 5700 XT is plagued by driver problems. Spend a few minutes browsing around for 5700 XT system hangs, restarts, sleep mode, etc. The user community is still pretty small which makes the amount of people having problems a large percentage. Tech support is hopeless. They act as if this is something unknown or new, or worse, they're just incompetent and clueless. Zero communication with the user base - which is basically a bunch of gaming enthusiasts with varying degrees of technical abilities. A 30 day return policy is a joke if you're building a system from scratch. Even if all the parts arrive at the same time and you're really quick at building systems. If you run into problems and need to return something, like a motherboard, or THIS CARD, you will only get one chance. Shipping back to Newegg and waiting for the replacement will take at least a week. Problems: Sleep mode (which is not available in Win 10 until installing the Radeon drivers). Goes into sleep mode ok. Not coming out. Sometimes it does a full restart, sometimes tries to come out, but hangs, sometimes BSOD, sometimes ok. But it ALWAYS drops any non-system drives from Win Explorer if it comes out of sleep mode without hanging. Event logs show Event 157 - Drive X has been surprise removed. So, here's the solution for this problem: Turn off sleep mode and don't use it. Plagued by random system hangs, restarts, BSOD. Windows event logs show Bugcheck 0x00000116, When the system is able to create a dump (which many times it doesn't), it always shows one or all of the following offenders in the dump stack: dxgkrnl.sys, atikmdag.sys, ntoskrnl .exe This problem has been going on at least since August 2019 according to the problem reports in the AMD community forums. AMD said the problem should be resolved in 19.9.2. Nope. Stepped all the way to 19.11.3, same problem still exists.   Overall Review: Not only would I NOT recommend this GPU, I recommend staying as far away as possible. The card may be fine, but it's impossible to tell because the Radeon drivers cause all sorts of system problems and instability. And it's repeatable every time. So far, I've rebuilt a brand new system 3 times with new/different components, and it's sadly amazing to watch a very solid system turn into garbage as soon as the Radeon drivers are installed. Every time. I can't believe these companies are putting this untested garbage on the market before it's ready. I'm not interested in being a beta tester. Actually, it's more like an alpha tester.    1 out of 2 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!     Manufacturer Response:  Sorry to hear about the issues you are having. The drivers issues from launch are now under control and the newest drivers have proven very stable and solid. I suggest a Safe Mode DDU of the system and install the latest drivers.           Anthony O.  Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         4 / 5   Great card  11/16/2019 12:20:34 PM       Pros: Plays Red dead Redemption 2 with high/ultra settings with 100 plus FPS.   Cons: Drivers are still bad, but its getting better every update.   Overall Review: Great card, went from a RX 580 to this and it was a great purchase.    3 out of 3 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!          Derek T.  Ownership: 1 month to 1 year  Verified Owner         1 / 5   DOA  11/12/2019 5:29:13 PM       Pros: Wouldn't know.   Cons: Dead on Arrival. System works with XFX card.   Overall Review: Should test before return time is over. So much for buying parts in advance of the rest of computer build.    0 out of 4 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!          ALEXANDER C.  Ownership: 1 month to 1 year  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Wicked AF FUN  11/6/2019 9:39:59 AM       Pros: Perfect for 1440p gaming on a 144hz monitor at Ultra Settings!  Record your games, stream your games, make a gif instantly, save an instant replay if something awesome happened and choose how long the instant replay goes back in game time to capture your sweet moves. Three Display Ports!!!  And a single HDMI, exactly what I need because I have a top of the line 1440p and an old 1080p. Free Sync!  O my, its so awesome I cannot live without this in my gaming life ever again.   Cons: The overlay (alt+z by default) sometimes causes issues in games after bringing it up.  Using this to change settings appears to be the worse way (ie. doesn't always work/apply your settings) and you may as well use the Radeon settings before you even startup your game because the overlay will most likely degrade the performance even after you close it.  This seems to happen more often than not but I've definitely used it as little as possible after learning my lesson.   Overall Review: I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants above 60fps in the newest games at 2k resolution aka 1440p.  I am unable to comment on 4k.  Recording games or desktop is super simple and has no noticeable impact on performance or fps and saving a minute long 'instant replays' doesn't even cause a stutter but it could be my system in general helping a lot with that, FYI this is in a new 3600x system on a x570 TUF Gaming board, 16GB of 3600mhz, and it is saving everything to an M.2 drive. Some games I've tested all with FreeSync ON and V-sync OFF: `CSGO @ 2k max settings 200 - 300 FPS (staying near the middle and upper-side of this range) Apex Legends @ 2k max settings 80 - 120 FPS (avg nearer the lower side) `Forza 4 Horizon @ 2k max settings 72FPS exactly (note: this game offers a benchmark to suggest settings and attempts to his a target # of FPS; unclear if that # is changeable, and there is a dynamic option which I've left off) `Rocket League @ 2k max settings was tested, however, I've forgotten the values but I can tell you the experience was velvety smooth like freshly waxed genitalia.    1 out of 2 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!          Anonymous  Ownership: 1 month to 1 year  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Cool as ice; quiet as a panther  10/29/2019 10:29:36 AM       Pros: -thermals never exceed 80 Celsius (even with +50% power limit in WattMan) -incredible BANG for your BUCK -crushes games at 1440p to the degree that teen pregnancies crush hopes & dreams -virtually silent in 90% of the games I play   Cons: -occasional black screens (drivers have minimized this since first use) -can get somewhat noisy while running particularly intensive games (we're looking at you, Borderlands 3)   Overall Review: Sapphire asking for just a $10 premium on AMD's noisy reference design makes said design obsolete - because this custom cooler seems to work magic for AMD.  Previously I had a PULSE Vega 56 and that ran at around the same thermals and fan noise albeit the 5700 XT consuming less power than Vega.  If you're upgrading and deciding between this and the RTX 2070 Super, you should give the XT the cake.    5 out of 6 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Runs pretty quietly too!   Cons: Drivers are a bit of an issue LED lighting can only be red   Overall Review: Pretty good to be honest, drivers are fine now, but still would like to see more color choices :)    Did you find this review helpful?

Cons: - Driver issues caused a lot of blue screens, so it's going to be a lot of trial and error to get the card stable   Overall Review: I recommend the card if you're willing to take time to work through the driver issues    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.

NVIDIA TURING™ ARCHITECTURE  This revolutionary architecture, combined with our all-new GeForce® RTX platform, fuses together real-time ray tracing, artificial intelligence and programmable shading. You've never created and enjoyed games like this before.           Performance  GeForce ® RTX gaming GPUs come loaded with next-generation GDDR6 memory, support for DirectX 12 features and more.

VR audio, physics, and haptics let you hear and feel every moment.          WINDFORCE 3X COOLING SYSTEM  The WINDFORCE 3X cooling system features 3x 82mm unique blade fans, an alternate spinning fan, 6x composite copper heat pipes, heat-pipe direct touch and 3D active fan functionality, together delivering an effective heat-dissipation capacity for higher performance at lower temperatures.               ALTERNATE SPINNING  The GIGABYTE “Alternate Spinning” is the only solution that can solve the turbulent airflow of three fans. The biggest problem with the three fans is turbulence. Since the fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction is opposite between the fans, which will cause turbulent airflow and reduce heat dissipation efficiency. GIGABYTE turns the middle fan in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing airflow pressure.         UNIQUE BLADE FAN  The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface, effectively enhancing the airflow.         3D ACTIVE FAN  The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. It allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle.            HEAT PIPES DIRECT TOUCH  The shape of the pure copper heat pipes maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU, enhancing heat transfer. The heat pipes also cover the VRAM through a large metal-plate contact to ensure proper cooling.         COMPOSITE HEAT PIPES  Each composite heat pipe combines thermal conductivity and phase transition to efficiently manage the heat transfer between two solid interfaces, increasing cooling capacity.        game in style  RGB FUSION 2.0  With 16.7M customizable color options and numerous lighting effects, you can choose lighting effects or synchronize with other AORUS devices.       BUILT STRONG        Extreme durability and overclocking  The graphics card uses the better power phases design to allow the MOSFET to operate at lower temperature, and over-temperature protection design and load balancing for each MOSFET, plus the Ultra Durable certified chokes and capacitors, to provide excellent performance and longer system life.         POWER INDICATORS  The smart power LED indicator alerts the player when any PCI-E power supply is abnormal.   Light On: power cable disconnected.  Light Off: Stable power supply.  Blinking: Abnormal power supply.      NVIDIA NVLink™ Support  Support for NVIDIA NVLink™ (NVIDIA SLI) technology, which combines two identical GPUs with an GeForce RTX NVLink Bridge to deliver the ultimate experience in 4K gaming or VR gaming. You can also adjust the light effect on the bridge with the AORUS Engine.            Protection Metal Backplate  The metal backplate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.         4-Year Warranty  We want you to experience the best service you have ever had. This is why, on top of our standard 3-year warranty, we would like to offer you an additional 1 year of protection to your graphics card—free of charge. You can enjoy a 4-year warranty by registering on the website within 30 days of purchase.          IN TOTAL COMMAND  The interface and functionality of the software is subject to each model.

He has raved daily about the huge difference it has made in his gaming and graphics. Shipping and service from the company were excellent.   Overall Review: Great purchase.

Cons: Coil whine as said in other reviews, but I read and discovered all fan cooled card are going to have some type of hum or whine   Overall Review: I would purchase again    Did you find this review helpful?

Overall Review: I love this card    Did you find this review helpful?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!          Jason K.  Ownership: 1 day to 1 week  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Amazing!  11/24/2019 8:22:14 PM       Pros: Runs cool and quiet Minimal to no coil whine Overclocks great RGB light is nice and subdued First non EVGA GPU for me and it doesn't disappoint. 2055mhz-2100mhz clocks in game. 2055 and 2070 clocks nearly all the time   Cons: None. This card is great.   Overall Review: Card is longer than most obviously so it may block some drive bays in your case. I wish the RGB lighting was at least as bright as my Aorus z390 pro wifi board. Even at the brightest setting in fusion 2.0 it's still very dim compared to what's on the motherboard.    Did you find this review helpful?

Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         4 / 5   Works Lovely!  11/19/2019 2:15:33 PM       Pros: Great temps. Performance is what's promised and games run butter smooth on 1440p 144hz 27 inch montior.   Cons: Fans can be a touch on the loud side but its not too much of a bother for me at least just the only con i could think for this.   Overall Review: Card works great and looks sleek. Would reccomend this card for anyone not trying to break the bank and run 1440p 144hz rig.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!          KEVIN S.         2 / 5   Works if underclocked  10/28/2019 12:01:42 AM       Pros: Looks good and pretty quiet. No coil whine for me.   Cons: Causes reboots and driver crashes unless underclocked. This is in a case with great airflow and 21c ambient room temp. The game bonus I got (Control & Youngblood) did not work. After 12 days of emailing support they gave me working codes.   Overall Review: I would imagine my case is the exception and I got very unlucky. I'll be looking into getting a different card when I have time, but for now this has been very disappointing. 2 stars because it looks nice and they were able to resolve the issue with the game codes eventually. Unfortunately the games require 3rd party software to run and the card doesn't work properly.    0 out of 3 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!          Sakib R.         5 / 5   This card is awesome!!  10/13/2019 9:56:28 PM       Pros: -Very quiet, even with custom fan curves -Great cooler, stays below 65C while gaming under load in a warm room for me -An aesthetic card -Great performance at 1444p -No issues with drivers -Not too over the top with RBG   Cons: -None so far   Overall Review: I have had this card for about a week now and I absolutely love it! I just build my first ever machine and I initially went with ASRock 5700xt. It was great but I started having stutters and screen crashes. I updated drivers and it only got lead to more issues. I decided to sell that card and go with this Gigabyte 2070 Super Gaming OC. And wow what a difference. It has run flawlessly. It also came with COD MW for free as a promo! (October 2019) I could not be more happier about this card. I paid $410 for the 5700xt and the extra money for this card was more than worth it. I should have gone with something like this from the beginning.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!

Quiet - quiet - quiet.  AMD - AMD - AMD I love the relatively small size. It is a dense card and feels well built. It's square and lacks the GeeGaw nonsense sculpturing that's so typical of other cards. AMD's Wattman is a great utility to fine tune the performance. Water blocks are readily available. It overclocks well.   Cons: None for me. Reviewers typically admitted the card was a great performer but criticized the price, heat/power/noise and the Vega architecture as obsolete. Actually, the gaming performance is equivalent to similar priced cards. It has other capabilities you simply cannot buy anywhere else. Despite the rumors, it's still readily available. Due to the 16gb of HBM and the architecture it should be in demand for a long time. It is also the flagship Radeon and AMD has nothing better at this time. Vega is still being incorporated into new products such as the 3400g, and possibly the new Xbox. Regarding power consumption,  I used Wattman to auto undervolt the card. Coupled with the Chill setting, I'm just not seeing these issues. Running Dying Light at 4K with max settings the fans rarely go over 1000rpm and temps are typically less than 70c . When maxed out the card is about as noisy as my old Gigiabyte 7950 Windforce OC. With headphones I don't notice it at all.   Overall Review: I usually buy a card when the new cards perform about three times as fast as my old card. It will be a long time before they triple the performance of this baby.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Eduardo S.         5 / 5   Great Product From AMD  11/17/2019 10:52:12 PM       Pros: I've had this card for a while now, it replaced my 2 Vega64, it twice as fast and power efficient compared to my old Vega's. lots of VRAM 16Gb future proof to last a while. I've overclocked slightly and reduced voltages. I play every new AAA game in ultra at 1440P and easily getting over 75FPS with my FreeSync ultrawide monitor. frame times are very good and very smooth game play even at lower FPS, its really not about FPS' which everyone seems to think its important? frames times and smooth gaming with the least amounts of studders is whats important. I'm also an occasional miner and this card is getting over 80Mh/s in Eth with low power draw after tweaking it voltages and frequencies. I love this cards, I'm actually buying a 2nd one while still in stock.   Cons: End of life card, AMD has stopped producing them, It's not the Fastest GPU for the Price but who cares when its delivering the smoothest game play and best frame times. only one design no AIB partner card designs. no blower just three small fans, I actually like the blower design to expel the heat out of my case.   Overall Review: despite it's limited life I think AMD made a awesome card this will last me for a long time, no plans on replacing it. I think it's going to age very good, mostly all AMD GPU's age good.    1 out of 2 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!

It was fun while it lasted, wish it woulda' lasted 2 years though.    2 out of 22 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!

Overall Review: I bought two of these cards, one runs cool at 66C the other 77C while running the same game. Games run fine but why the big difference in temps. My guess is one card did not get any conductive past on the heat sink.    4 out of 12 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Ownership: 1 month to 1 year  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Hackintosh Wet Dream  7/2/2019 6:38:23 AM       Pros: Works beautifully. If you use blender you NEED this card. With Apple charging 6 grand for their Mac build yourself a powerful hackintosh instead and game on the side. This card runs quiet and only really ramps up the fans if you have the Auto OC. Undervolted this card is quieter than the 1080ti Strix it replaced.   Cons: When I first got the card one of the fan cables was a little loose and was rubbing one of the fans. I was able to fix quickly but I can see why somebody would be pretty angry off if their new $700 GPU was making broke car noises.    6 out of 6 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Cons: Heat is like 105 in a room of 60 degrees, and water cooling, like what?   Overall Review: I'm sure it's a great card if it worked, but I guess XFC aren't they best choice, I always picked Sapphire, and they never failed me, but this time I want to change because of the price, and now I hate XFC and the card as well.    1 out of 18 people found this review helpful.

Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         2 / 5   Decent rasterization performance, beyond trash driver support.  6/29/2019 2:30:59 PM       Pros: When it runs, it runs well. Comparable to the RTX 2080 that sits across the room from it in rasterization performance.   Cons: Where do I start? The last AMD GPU I owned was a Radeon 280X Reference. AMD still cannot write drivers to save their lives. 16.2.2 the card will randomly lock the entire system up, requiring a hard reset. 16.2.3 Anything that uses Radeon ReLive, once again causes the card to lock the entire system up, requiring a hard reset. I swore with the 280X that I would NEVER buy another AMD card, and this one just cements that idea. AMD's GPU design firm is a pathetic joke, and the asking price for this card is beyond laughable. This thing isn't worth $400, let alone the $680 I JUST paid for it. Very heavily considering returning this and just buying another Nvidia Turing GPU. This has been a complete nightmare, as the system was 100% stable with the GTX 780 that this sorry excuse for a card replaced. I'm running a EVGA 750W PSU, no overclock, and have the GPU quarantined on it's own two 12V rails. XFX's support website, upon registering the card the DAY I BOUGHT IT told me that it isn't covered under warranty, so just like with AMD's GPUs, I'll never waste my money on another XFX card again.   Overall Review: Save yourself the headache and the AMD fangirl loyalty, this card isn't worth the money. Even the experimental RTX GPU's are better than this, AND more stable. What a waste of time and money.    0 out of 19 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!

Can be offset with a custom curve using Precision X1, at risk of running hot. -Heavy -High power consumption. EVGA recommends 650w psu. HWInfo hasn't reported the card ever consuming that much, but may need juice for the rest of the rig too.   Overall Review: Awesome card, no complaints so far other than being a little loud. If your motherboard has flimsy pcie slots might want to consider a riser or support bracket.    Did you find this review helpful?

Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Really good, works, and doesnt get hot.  11/3/2019 2:21:18 PM       Pros: Great for 4k gaming @ 60hz or 1440p @1440+hz with max settings. Quiet Doesn't run hot.  >70c tops, normally @60c EVGA is great, and RGB logo looks nice.   Cons: Price to performance ratio is low for NVIDIA's higher end cards, 2070 is a better value.   Overall Review: 6  year upgrade so I chose the 2080 over 2070 (better value) for my 4k@60hz gaming.  I love it.  I ran 3d benchmark and it lifted me from 11% overall to 80% overall. Those % are with overclocking on both cards and include my old CPU for both. The new 2080 super runs all my games at max settings and still get around 60fps @ 4k resolution in the new COD Modern Warfare. Love the EVGA RGB on the side too, which you can change to any color you want.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

It makes the overall weight of the system much lighter, with added benefit of a potential VR rig. It is doing very well. 11 GB of onboard is about the same as the previous SLI arrangement.   Cons: NONE so far. Only been running it for about one week.   Overall Review: If you are looking for a quality video card, however a bit pricy, then look no further.    0 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Ownership: 1 month to 1 year  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Kicks my old cards out of the water  9/29/2019 6:36:36 AM       Pros: Performance Ray-Tracing & DLSS are outstanding in Control and other newer games that were coded /updated properly to support them. RGB Lighting Received a 3rd free game from EVGA   Cons: No SUPER on side where the RGB Lighting is at. Precision X1 sucks - Use MSI's Afterburner instead of it.   Overall Review: Blows my old SAPPHIRE NITRO+ RX 480 OC video card out of the water in benchmarks and has Ray-Tracing & DLSS in 2019. AMD doesn't have Ray-Tracing on any video card you can purchase right now.    Did you find this review helpful?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!          Nathan O.  Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         5 / 5   It works  9/25/2019 9:16:26 AM       Overall Review: I had an MSI GTX 1070 before I bought this and I can definitely feel the performance increase, and I like it a lot. Make sure you have good airflow in your case, it gets pretty warm (max I've hit is 86°C iirc). Paired with an R7 3700X I was able to run Control at 1440p at 70 fps average at ultra presets but activating ray tracing dropped me to around 55 or lower.    Did you find this review helpful?

Anonymous  Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Well worth the money!  8/26/2019 8:37:58 PM       Overall Review: I bought this because the 2070 Super was out of stock and I refused to buy a 2060 Super or a 2080 TI. It took it's dear sweet time getting here but the card runs great. It's fast, it's quiet and it just barely fit in my case. All of the requirements needed to make me happy. My only complaint is that the RGB's won't stay the color I selected (purple) unless the EVGA Precision app is open    2 out of 2 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Overall Review: Returning for a hopefully quieter replacement. Will update with better rating if warranted.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!     Manufacturer Response:  Thank you for your feedback, Coil whine can be caused at times by combinations of hardware pieces, you can try to find which component can be causing the coil whine by testing the hardware in a different system. In this case, you can test your graphics card in a different system to see if the coil whine follows the graphics card. You can also try to burn in the graphics card with a stress test over night to see if that will help mitigate the audible coil whine. Other wise you can contact our support team for assistance and refer to this ticket number 3643563. You can contact our support team via phone at 1.888.881.3842 or via email at support@evga.com.

Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Just what I wanted  11/20/2019 5:58:18 PM       Pros: Admittedly I'm a little hard of hearing but I can't hear the fans running. According to Precision X1 they are running at 50% under load. The temps stay in the 60s to low 70s while playing Red Dead Redemption II and Borderlands 3 @ 2560 x 1440 140 hz. on ultra to high settings 90 ~ 120 fps. The main reasons why I bought this card is RDR 2 kept defaulting to 1920 x 1080 with my GTX 980 Ti and Cyberpunk 2077 is going to support ray tracing April 16 2020.   Cons: None so far.   Overall Review: I recommend this card for those like me that aren't going to pop for the RTX 2080 Ti. I'm happy with this card.    4 out of 4 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Works wonderfully.    Did you find this review helpful?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!          valued c.  Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         5 / 5   Best card I have owned  11/4/2019 8:27:47 AM       Pros: Fast good overclocking well built   Cons: Price what can be said   Overall Review: Change the thermal paste on all my cards as I do using Gelid Thermal Extreme. Card rarely hits 70c even overclocking to 2100 on core it sets at around 65 to 68 c some times it clocks higher at times lower, never goes below 2050ghz. Mem overclocked 500 ghz easy. However games using Real-Time Ray Tracing dont seem to like overclocking and crash often. They play fine without the overclock so I cant say much. Good upgrade from my gtx 1080.    2 out of 2 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!          Kyle A.  Ownership: 1 month to 1 year  Verified Owner         4 / 5   Great performance with minor hiccups  10/6/2019 6:49:37 AM       Pros: -Temps are cool. -Performance is phenomenal.  90fps with Ultra and high ray tracing in Control.  200 fps on overwatch on high settings.  160 fps on PUBG with high settings.  150 fps on BF1 with ultra settings.  All on 1440p.   Cons: -Weird things are happening that I can only fix by reseating the display port connection to the card.  Such as in PUBG, sometimes when I alt+esc out of the game, when I return to the game my whole computer freezes and starts flashing black.  Just today my 144 Hz monitor got stuck in a global 60 Hz frame rate cap.  Updated drivers, restarted computer to no avail.  The Nvidia control panel was missing entirely.  After digging it up through windows control panel I found that the 60 Hz refresh rate was selected in the resolution tab. After switching to 144Hz and selecting ""Apply"" the screen flashed, frame rate monitor still says I am only getting 60 Hz, asked if I wanted to keep or revert settings. I select keep and the settings went back to 60 Hz anyway.  In both instances, the problem was immediately solved by unplugging DP cable from the card and re-inserting it.  Not sure who is to blame here, but I'm leaning towards the card being the culprit, so this minor inconvenience is preventing me from giving 5 stars.   Overall Review: Don't listen to jerk wads that are upset that it's not a generational leap forward compared to 1080Ti.  When you compare price, it's a huge value over 1080Ti.  I came from 2 GTX 480 in SLI and this card blows them out of the water.    2 out of 3 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

(60 fps @ 4K with most quality settings maxed.). GPU stays under 50C as I have it configured and the radiator dumps most of the heat outside my case.   Cons: For a card this expensive, you should be able to control pump speed and noise without all the steps I've listed elsewhere. Documentation spotty, and contradicting statements on what the ""Normal / OC"" switch does.   Overall Review: Complaints about pump noise are real.  In a quiet case you'll notice it the first time you turn it on.  It's a beer fridge hum as others have indicated and stands out from fan noise.  For me, it was audible 5 feet away from within a closed case.  It is fixable, but fixing it requires that you have two fan headers available for which you can set different curves: 1 PWM (for radiator fan), 1 3-pin (for pump), 1 male-to-female PWM cable (connects pump to fan header), and fan control software like Argus.  You have to remove the shroud, disconnect the combo fan/pump cable, connect the pump to a fan header via extender cable, and connect the radiator fan directly to another fan header.  You then use Argus or other fan control software with custom fan curves to control the pump and fan.  You'll need to use voltage control for the pump.  My pump was stable idle at 40%, and is set to quickly ramp up to 80% then 100% as GPU temp increases.  Fan is set similarly.  No more pump noise when idle, and barely audible under load, especially with the game sound.  I also replaced the stock radiator fan with a Noctua.  Stock fan isn't bad but the Noctua is quieter at higher RPM. There are more specific guides online.  Also, you can refer to the documentation for the standalone EVGA Hybrid kit.    1 out of 1 people found this review helpful.  Did you?

Ownership: 1 day to 1 week  Verified Owner         1 / 5   DOA Defective on arrival  9/19/2019 6:49:27 PM       Overall Review: Packaging was odd, card doesn't have the FTW3 logo on the side. Instead it has the Super logo which doesn't match images. Card AIO pump has a loud... old fridge freezer hum to it and the installations failed every time and said it couldn't be installed on LTSB and Windows 10. I have used several AIO's over the past years and never have I had a pump so loud or bubbly (bubbles go away) I can't comment on the performance as it didn't work in the 3 different computers it was plugged into. I have issued an RMA and I'll be sending it into in tomorrow morning. I understand defective products exist but I've bought nearly 20 evga products over the years (PSUs, GPUs, Coolers) and never had a dead product    4 out of 7 people found this review helpful.

Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         5 / 5   This card is 2080 super is a beast  9/17/2019 9:45:30 AM       Pros: Relatively quiet at all times , very overclockable, can handle most 4k Games at 60Hz   Cons: I didn't get the free Call of Duty Modern Warefare, Price, X1 precision software isn't good at all, pump cables could be longer.   Overall Review: I had have no intentions of ever playing Wolfenstein or Control....I wish I had purchased 2 weeks later and received the Call of Duty Modern Warfare. You guys better take advantage before this card sells out once again    2 out of 2 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!

Performance wise - I get 2025 on the boost clock after applying a curve from OC Scanner.   Overall Review: Great card and worth the extra $$.    2 out of 2 people found this review helpful.

Anonymous  Ownership: 1 week to 1 month  Verified Owner         5 / 5   50+ fps on Metro Exodus 4k ultra settings  8/7/2019 3:45:23 AM       Pros: -Outperforms my Auros 1080ti WATERFORCE which is why I bought it. -Stays under 60 C at full load. Which is also better. -Quiet. -Ray tracing is nice I guess.   Cons: -Software is nice but doesn't have stock overclocks like Auros. -Not an Auros 2080ti waterforce (but good grief that's more than I spent building my teir 1 PC with a 4k TV)   Overall Review: Runs everything I have maxed out in 4k. Pretty much same price I paid for my Auros 1080ti WATERFORCE 2 years ago. Performs better than it does at 4k with new bells and whistles, which is what I was going for. It's hot here so I need it to stay cool which it does. I'm happy. Would recommend. Unless you have enough to buy 2. Then buy a 2080TI. Will update if anything changes.    3 out of 3 people found this review helpful.  Did you?  Yes  No        Thanks for the valuable feedback you provided!
